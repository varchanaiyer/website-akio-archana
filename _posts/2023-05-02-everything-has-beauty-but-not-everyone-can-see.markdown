As a South Asian woman with over five years of experience in data science and artificial intelligence, I've realized that my journey in the tech world is anything but ordinary. I am a data product manager with Women Who Code in Singapore. However, the path to where I am today was filled with obstacles and challenges unique to South Asian women in the tech industry.


The road to becoming an engineer in India is paved with grueling exams and fierce competition. One such exam is the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE), which over 1.5 million aspirants attempt annually. Success in this exam opens the doors to prestigious institutions like the Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT). Despite the rising number of female students in these institutions, the gender disparity remains stark, with women comprising only around 20% of the student population.



Pursuing a career in engineering often leads South Asian women to seek opportunities abroad. However, this decision is sometimes criticized, as some view immigrants as threats to the local job market. The truth is that many of us choose to leave our home countries due to concerns about safety and the lack of opportunities for professional growth. India has one of the highest rates of sexual assault and related crimes, with a woman being subjected to rape every 15 minutes, according to the National Crime Records Bureau's 2019 report.



Next time you meet a South Asian colleague, take the time to talk to them about their experiences and the unique challenges they've faced. We all have stories to share, and understanding these challenges can help foster a more inclusive work environment.

Even for those who stay in their home countries, the challenges persist. Many South Asian women in tech face the difficult choice of leaving their careers early for various reasons, including child-rearing. In India, for instance, a 2018 World Bank report found that around 20 million women had left the workforce between 2005 and 2018, with a significant proportion citing family responsibilities as the primary reason for their exit.



So, what can be done to bridge this gap and create a more inclusive environment for South Asian women in tech? Mentorship, networking opportunities, and increased visibility are crucial. Organisations like Women Who Code provide invaluable support for women like me, enabling us to connect, learn, and grow in our careers.



As I continue my journey in the tech industry, I'm committed to using my experiences to help empower the next generation of South Asian women engineers. By sharing our stories and breaking down barriers, we can create a more equitable and diverse tech industry that benefits us all.

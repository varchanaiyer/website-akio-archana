Did you know that over half of the world's population is bilingual? Yet, many people still struggle to express themselves effectively in English, their second language. The need for language accessibility is crucial, as most consumers prefer to buy products in their native language, and website visitors tend to leave if they can't understand the content.

As a team that relates to this problem, we decided to create a Chrome extension using ChatGPT to help non-native English speakers communicate effectively in their professional lives.

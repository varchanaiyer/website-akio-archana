Hello and welcome! I'm a passionate data strategist and champion for diversity in tech, currently serving as a Data Product Manager at Women Who Code and a board member at Women in Machine Learning. My journey in the world of technology spans various roles, from Artificial Intelligence Engineer at Continental to Data Scientist at DHL Express. Along the way, I've nurtured a deep interest in TinyML, and have produced several courses for Linkedin Learning in this domain.

My current projects encapsulate my love for AI and empowering others in their tech journey. I am the architect behind Speaker Scribe, a free AI-powered platform that leverages GPT-4 to create tailored conference proposals, simplifying your process and boosting success rates. Additionally, I curate the ScaleDown Newsletter, a potent source for insights on MLOps, LLMs, and TinyMLOps.

My commitment to diversity and inclusion extends beyond my professional pursuits, reflected in my efforts to mentor women technologists during the pandemic and foster collaborations with global companies through Women Who Code. As a believer in continuous learning, I'm also an MBA student at NUS, weaving together the worlds of business and tech.

I invite you to explore, engage, and join me on this exciting journey of data-driven transformation and impactful change!

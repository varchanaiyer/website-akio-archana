    content : "It's rare that you come across standout talent like Archana! I had the pleasure of co-leading a technical workshop to launch International Women's Day at the London School of Economics with Archana. We have worked alongside each other as Fellows at Women Who Code for some time, but this was our first opportunity to really build and execute a project together. I was particularly impressed by Archana's high level of technical proficiency, and her depth of technical knowledge. Further, her teaching style invites learners in to engage and ask questions. No matter the time of day, Archana shows up with a smile and a huge bucket of enthusiasm. Archana is certainly an asset to any team lucky enough to have her."

What impresses me about Archana is her love for the Technology/Women in Technology community where she volunteers and helps out at a lot of external events on top of her day job. She has a lot of passion for Technology and is inspiring in the ways that she goes above and beyond. She would be a lovely addition to any firms she joins and any firm would be lucky to have her!"

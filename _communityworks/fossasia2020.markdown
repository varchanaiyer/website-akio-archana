Edge Computing is a computing paradigm where deep learning models are run on devices with little computational power, like a Raspberry Pi. This reduces the dependence on cloud services for using AI and also increases security and reduces latency. OpenVINO is an open-source software toolkit from Intel that abstracts away hardware related details and helps deep learning engineers and researchers build AI applications for the edge. In this talk, I will explain the features of OpenVINO, the different tools it contains and how you can use OpenVINO to easily deploy and maintain all your Deep Learning and Edge Computing applications. In particular, I will show you how you can deploy a deep learning model for detecting soiling on solar panels, a task which needs edge computing, especially if you have large solar farms, to an edge computing device called the Neural Compute Stick, using OpenVINO and DevCloud

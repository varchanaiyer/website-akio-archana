Come learn how to run a model on edge or microcontrollers the size of your palm! In this study group series we will start from the basics of edge computing and then will move on to techniques of pruning and quantisation with also giving you a balance of knowledge on hardware too.
Basic knowledge of Neural Networks and linear algebra required.
